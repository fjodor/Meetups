Wolf Riepl is a Radio and TV technician and a Sociologist by training. At university he worked with SPSS and Stata. His first contact to R came in 2007, when he worked for a small company that thought about avoiding the SPSS licence fees. After a 2-day-workshop he vowed to never open the R software again. It took seven years to start the next attempt. Since late 2014, Wolf has been working his way into R and never looked back. He now focuses on workshops and trainings, mostly online since 2020 after many in-person-workshops since 2017.
